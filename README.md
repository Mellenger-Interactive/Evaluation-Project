The existing data should be moved by both such as manually or by migrating scripts.As it depends upon various factors such as:-
1)while dealing with large data movements.
2)Changing the data type or size of a column(In this case  manually data moved.)
3)Splitting or merging columns:- manual migration script to create the new column(s), run custom SQL to move the data, and then drop the original column(s).
4)No errors or ambiguity while migrating by script.
